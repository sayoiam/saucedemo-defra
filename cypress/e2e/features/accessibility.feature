Feature: Accessibility Compliance
  As a user with accessibility needs
  I want the SauceDemo application to be fully accessible
  So that I can use the application with assistive technologies

  Background:
    Given I am on the SauceDemo login page

  @accessibility @screen-reader
  Scenario: Screen reader compatibility
    Then all page content should be readable by screen readers
    And form labels should be properly associated
    And headings should be properly structured
    And landmarks should be properly defined

  @accessibility @error-handling
  Scenario: Accessible error handling
    When I trigger form validation errors
    Then error messages should be announced to screen readers
    And errors should be clearly associated with form fields
    And error states should be visually and programmatically indicated

  @accessibility @dynamic-content
  Scenario: Dynamic content accessibility
    Given I login as "standard_user"
    When I add products to cart
    Then cart updates should be announced to screen readers
    And dynamic content changes should be accessible
    And loading states should be accessible
